#### Process Steps
* Spent about an hour searching databases for a data set that would analyze something we are interested by. Topics included environmental, health, absurd/goofy things, San Francisco. 
* Decided to go with World Happiness. Given the state of the world right now, we wanted to spend our time looking at the good in the world. 
* Clean data sets so that we can combine them and do analysis across years. 
* There are 6 variables that were analyzed in this study, so we each took 1-2 variables to do a statistical analaysis on. 
* Convened to look at insights on these 6 variables and to determine next steps.
